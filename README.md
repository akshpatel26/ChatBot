# 🚀 How to Use the Chatbot from Google Drive 

📥 Step 1: Click the link and open the Google Drive page (it’ll say “No preview available”—that’s normal!).

📥 Step 2: Click the Download button; if warned, choose “Keep” or “Allow.”

💻 Step 3: Find the downloaded file in your Downloads folder (or extract it if zipped).

🚀 Step 4: Double-click the .exe file; if SmartScreen pops up, click More info > Run anyway.


# 🔒 Important Notes

✅ You can’t run .exe files directly from Drive—download them first.

✅ Windows might warn you about unknown publishers—click “More info > Run anyway.”

✅ Always scan downloaded files for safety.
# 🔑 Gemini API Key

This project uses Google’s Gemini API.

 • Sign up at Gemini AI to obtain an API key.

 • Replace the placeholder in self.API_KEY with your actual key.
 
 • Without a valid key, only static responses work.
